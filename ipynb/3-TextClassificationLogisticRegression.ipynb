We cleaned and preprocessed the data, applied TF-IDF for text representation, and trained logistic regression models using both One-vs-Rest and multi-class approaches. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 79%, with the \"Neutral\" class showing the lowest performance due to data scarcity. To achieve better results, more advanced models such as Recurrent Neural Networks and transformers like BERT could be employed. These models can capture the complexities of natural language more effectively, leading to significantly improved performance. We will explore these advanced models in future notebooks."],"metadata":{"id":"fXj_0yyMViSd"}}]}
